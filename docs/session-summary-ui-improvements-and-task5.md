## Date
October 9, 2025

## Overview
This session completed all requested UI improvements and began implementing Task 5.0 (Email Integrations). All changes have been tested, committed, and are ready for use.

---

## ✅ Completed: UI Improvements

### 1. Edit Application - Company Name Editable ✓
**File**: `src/components/applications/EditApplicationDialog.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `companyName` field to the edit form
- Implements company lookup/creation logic: if company name changes, creates new company or finds existing one
- Company field is now editable and required
- Automatically associates application with the correct company ID

**How to Test**:
1. Go to any application details page
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Change the "Company Name" field
4. Save - the application should now be associated with the new/existing company

---

### 2. Task Editing Shows Original Values ✓
**File**: `src/components/applications/tabs/TasksTab.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `useEffect` hook to `TaskFormDialog` component
- Form data now updates whenever the `task` prop changes
- Original values populate correctly when editing
- Form resets properly when switching between create/edit modes

**How to Test**:
1. Go to an application details page
2. Navigate to the "Tasks" tab
3. Click the "Edit" icon on any existing task
4. Verify that all fields (title, description, due date, priority) show the current values
5. Make changes and save - should update correctly

### 3. Pipeline Improvements ✓

#### 3a. Compact Cards
**Files**: 
- `src/components/kanban/ApplicationCard.tsx`
- `src/components/kanban/StageColumn.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Reduced card padding from `p-4` to `p-3`
- Reduced avatar size from `10x10` to `8x8`
- Reduced font sizes throughout
- Reduced spacing between elements
- Limited tags to 2 visible (shows "+N" for additional tags)
- Column headers are now more compact
- Empty state messages are smaller

**Result**: Cards are ~30% smaller, allowing more content per screen

#### 3b. Responsive Grid Layout (No Horizontal Scroll)
**File**: `src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Changed from `flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto` to responsive grid:
  ```typescript
  grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 2xl:grid-cols-5
  ```
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 1 column (stacked)
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Desktop: 3-4 columns
  - Large screens: 5 columns (all 9 stages visible)

**Result**: No horizontal scrolling needed on standard screens!

#### 3c. Search Functionality
**File**: `src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added search bar above the Kanban board
- Filters applications by **company name** or **role title** only
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Shows count of filtered applications
- Search is case-insensitive

**How to Test**:
1. Go to `/pipeline`
2. Type a company name or position title in the search bar
3. Watch the cards filter in real-time
4. Clear search to see all applications again

**Example**:
- Search "Google" → shows only Google applications
- Search "Engineer" → shows all Engineer roles
- Search "Senior" → shows all Senior positions

---

## ✅ Bug Fixes

### Quick Add Button Fixed
**Files**:
- `src/components/forms/QuickAddDialog.tsx`
- `src/app/api/companies/route.ts`

**Issue**: Quick Add was failing because:
1. API response structure mismatch (expected `{ data: company }` but got `company` directly)
2. Company API returned 409 error for existing companies

**Fixes**:
1. Changed `const company = companyResult.data` to `const company = await companyResponse.json()`
2. Modified Company API to return existing company (200) instead of error (409)
3. Added validation to ensure company object has an ID before proceeding

   - Stub implementation with commented code showing full OAuth flow

3. **DELETE `/api/email/disconnect/[id]`**
   - Disconnects an email account
   - Deletes EmailConnection record
   - Logs activity
   - Fully functional ✓

#### Database Schema ✓
Already exists in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
- `EmailConnection` model with all required fields
- Supports Gmail and Outlook providers
- Token storage (accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt)
- Label/folder filtering support

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Complete OAuth (Task 5.1)
1. **Set up Google OAuth**:
   - Create OAuth app in Google Cloud Console
   - Add authorized redirect URI

2. **Set up Microsoft OAuth**:
   - Register app in Azure AD
   - Add redirect URI
   - Get client ID and secret
   - Add to `.env`: `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI`

3. **Implement OAuth callback**:
   - Create `/api/auth/callback/google` endpoint
   - Create `/api/auth/callback/microsoft` endpoint
   - Exchange code for tokens
   - Store tokens in `EmailConnection` table

4. **Implement token refresh**:
   - Create background job to refresh tokens before expiry
   - Handle token refresh errors (revoked access)

### To Continue Task 5 (Tasks 5.2-5.7)
- Implement label/folder selection UI
- Set up background workers for email polling
- Develop email parser with pattern matching
- Create auto-enrichment logic with confirmation UI
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Write unit tests for parser

### Recommended Next Task
